    "## Business Understanding.\n",
    "Medicaid is a government health program that is funded by both the State goverment and federal goverment in the United States. It is a program that helps cover for medical expenses of the middle income individuals making access to health care and medication easier and affordable. It is able to subsidize the cost of medication by paying for medical bills claimed by the various hospitals or pharamacies that have are covered under the rebate agreement with the federal government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key stakeholders are the state and federal government that are responsible for the funding of the program, alongside the policymakers and decision makers in the healthcare industry. This project basically helps us use the collected data over the years to identify patterns, predict spending, identify the high cost and low cost drugs and identify any possible loopholes such as reimbursing manufacturers that are not part of the rebate agreement leading to loss of money for Medicaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it can help Medicaid in forecasting drug spending for better budget allocation and negotiate drug costs in the future. Some of the challenges we faced in this project is the large nature of our dataset, since it contains data that has been collected over the last decade which can be difficult to run models on without a powerful CPU, large number of missing values and the changing or flactuating drug prices of various drugs in the market.\n",

    "## Problem Statement.\n",
    "Medicaid has been spending millions of dollars on the payment of prescribed drugs by patients all over the country. Spending has increased making it difficult to monitor and control costs effectively. Data that has been collected over the years is huge and scattered so it is very difficult to identify the most used drugs, the most expensive drugs, how drug use differs between states and how to save money and make better decisions in future.Cureent reporting system mainly describes pas spending but fails to accurately predict future expenditures. Without predictive machine learning tools, stakeholders struggle to identify high cost drugs early and allocate budgets efficiently.This project aims to develop a machine learning  model that predicts drug spending based on utilization and reimbursement data available. This in the long run helps stakeholders in better decision making and budget allocation through interactive dashboards and a website that will be available for users to check future spending of specific drugs according to various descriptions."
